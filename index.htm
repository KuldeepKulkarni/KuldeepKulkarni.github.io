              <p>The goal of this paper is to present a non-iterative and more importantly an extremely fast algorithm to reconstruct images from compressively sensed (CS) random measurements.  To this end, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture which takes in CS measurements of an image as input and outputs  an intermediate  reconstruction.  We call this network, <em> ReconNet </em>. The intermediate reconstruction is fed into an off-the-shelf denoiser to obtain the final reconstructed image. On a standard dataset of images we show significant improvements in reconstruction results (both in terms of PSNR and time complexity) over state-of-the-art iterative CS reconstruction algorithms at various measurement rates. Further, through qualitative experiments on real data collected using our block single pixel camera (SPC), we show that our network is highly robust to sensor noise and can recover visually better quality images than competitive algorithms at extremely low sensing rates of 0.1 and 0.04. To demonstrate that our algorithm can recover semantically informative images even at a low measurement rate of 0.01, we present a very robust proof of concept real-time visual tracking application.

              <p>We propose a framework called <em> ReFInE </em> to directly obtain integral image estimates from a very small number of spatially multiplexed measurements of the scene without iterative reconstruction of any auxiliary image, and demonstrate their practical utility in visual object tracking. Specifically, we design measurement matrices which are tailored to facilitate extremely fast estimation of the integral image, by using a single-shot linear operation on the measured vector. Leveraging a prior model for the images, we formulate a nuclear norm minimization problem with second order conic constraints to jointly obtain the measurement matrix and the linear operator. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we show that high quality integral image estimates can be obtained using our framework at very low measurement rates. Further, on a standard dataset of 50 videos, we present object tracking results which are comparable to the state-of-the-art methods, even at an extremely low measurement rate of 1%.

        <p>	Persistent surveillance from camera networks, such as at parking lots, UAVs, etc., often results in large amounts of video data, resulting in significant challenges for inference in terms of storage, communication and computation. Compressive cameras have emerged as a potential solution to deal with the data deluge issues in such applications. However, inference tasks such as action recognition require high quality features which implies reconstructing the original video data. Much work in compressive sensing (CS) theory is geared towards solving the reconstruction problem, where state-of-the-art methods are computationally intensive and provide low-quality results at high compression rates. Thus, reconstruction-free methods for inference are much desired. In this paper, we propose reconstruction-free methods for action recognition from compressive cameras at high compression ratios of 100 and above.  Recognizing actions directly from CS measurements requires features which are mostly nonlinear and thus not easily applicable. This leads us to search for such properties that are preserved in compressive measurements. To this end, we propose the use of spatio-temporal smashed filters, which are compressive domain versions of pixel-domain matched filters. We conduct experiments on publicly available databases  and show that one can obtain recognition rates that are comparable to the oracle method in uncompressed setup, even for high compression ratios.

        <p>Spatial-multiplexing cameras have emerged as a promising
alternative to classical imaging devices, often enabling
acquisition of "more for less". One popular architecture for
spatial multiplexing is the single-pixel camera (SPC), which
acquires coded measurements of the scene with pseudorandom
spatial masks. Significant theoretical developments
over the past few years provide a means for reconstruction
of the original imagery from coded measurements at sub-
Nyquist sampling rates. Yet, accurate reconstruction generally
requires high measurement rates and high signal-tonoise
ratios. In this paper, we enquire if one can perform
high-level visual inference problems (e.g. face recognition
or action recognition) from compressive cameras without
the need for image reconstruction. This is an interesting
question since in many practical scenarios, our goals extend
beyond image reconstruction. However, most inference
tasks often require non-linear features and it is not clear
how to extract such features directly from compressed measurements.
In this paper, we show that one can extract nontrivial
correlational features directly without reconstruction
of the imagery. As a specific example, we consider the problem
of face recognition beyond the visible spectrum e.g in
the short-wave infra-red region (SWIR), where pixels are
expensive. We base our framework on smashed filters which
suggests that inner-products between high-dimensional signals
can be computed in the compressive domain to a high
degree of accuracy. We collect a new face image dataset
of 30 subjects, obtained using an SPC. Using face recognition
as an example, we show that one can indeed perform
reconstruction-free inference with a very small loss of accuracy
at very high compression ratios of 100 and more.

<p>Recent advances in camera architectures and associated mathematical representations now enable compressive acquisition of images and videos at low data-rates. In such a setting, we consider the problem of human activity recognition, which is an important inference problem in many security and surveillance applications. We propose a framework for understanding human activities as a non-linear dynamical system, and propose a robust, generalizable feature that can be extracted directly from the compressed measurements without recon-structing the original video frames. The proposed feature is termed recurrence texture and is motivated from recurrence analysis of non-linear dynamical systems. We show that it is possible to obtain discriminative features directly from the compressed stream and show its utility in recognition of activities at very low data rates.
